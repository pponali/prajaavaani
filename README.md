# Indian Audience Concerns & Leaderboard App - Application Specification

## Overview

This document outlines the core features and requirements for the iOS application designed for the Indian audience. The app enables users to create and share concerns, interact via upvotes and downvotes, and view leaderboard rankings that are segmented by various geographic levelsâ€”from regions and villages to the country level.

## Key Features

1. **User Authentication**
   - **Sign-Up and Login**: Users can sign up and log in using their mobile number.
   - **Security & Verification**: Mobile OTP verification will be used to authenticate users.

2. **Concerns Posting**
   - **Post Creation**: Users can create posts or "concerns".
   - **Optional Author Name**: Author name at the post level is optional.
   - **Content Submission**: Posts may include text (and possibly images or additional details in future phases).

3. **Voting Mechanism**
   - **Upvotes and Downvotes**: Each concern can be upvoted or downvoted by other users.
   - **Dynamic Positioning**: The total count of upvotes and downvotes determines the concern's position on the leaderboard.

4. **Leaderboards**
   - **Hierarchy of Leaderboards**: Leaderboards are available at multiple geographic levels:
     - Region
     - Villages
     - Town
     - Cities
     - Pincodes
     - Districts
     - States
     - Country
   - **Navigation Flexibility**: Users can quickly switch between leaderboards by various criteria, ensuring ease of access and relevance.
   - **Sorting Mechanism**: Concerns on leaderboards are sorted based on net votes (upvotes minus downvotes) ensuring the most pressing or relevant concerns appear at the top.

5. **User Experience (UX)**
   - **Intuitive Interface**: The app should offer a very good, clean, and intuitive user experience.
   - **Easy Navigation**: Users should be able to smoothly navigate between various leaderboard types and easily locate concerns relevant to their locality.
   - **Responsiveness**: Ensure the app is responsive and performs well on all supported iOS devices.
   - **Accessibility**: Design interfaces considering accessibility guidelines to reach a diverse audience.

## Functional Requirements

- **Mobile Number Authentication**: 
  - Implement OTP-based mobile number verification.
  - User profile setup with mobile number as the primary unique identifier.

- **Concern Creation Module**:
  - Text input field for creating the concern.
  - Option to include an author name (optional).
  - Ability to attach additional media in future versions (if required).

- **Voting System**:
  - Capability for users to upvote or downvote each concern.
  - Maintain a count of upvotes and downvotes in a real-time or near-real-time manner.
  - Mechanism to prevent multiple votes from a single user on the same concern.

- **Leaderboard Module**:
  - Develop different views for various geographic leaderboard segments.
  - Sorting functionality based on net votes.
  - Filters to view concerns based on specific geographic parameters (e.g., region, village, town, etc.).

- **Navigation and UX**:
  - Clear, simple navigation with a focus on usability.
  - Smooth transitions between user actions.
  - Clean visual design aligned with modern iOS design principles.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: 
  - Fast response times for loading concerns and updating votes.
  - Optimization for handling high traffic and database writes (especially during peak times).

- **Security**:
  - Secure storage of user credentials and mobile numbers.
  - Ensure that the voting mechanism is tamper-proof with proper validations.
  - Implement data encryption for sensitive data, especially during transmission.

- **Scalability**:
  - Design backend architecture to scale based on increasing users and concerns.
  - Modular design to support future feature expansions such as comment sections or multimedia sharing.

- **Maintainability and Extensibility**:
  - Codebase should be well-documented and modular for ease of updates.
  - Use of standard architectural patterns (e.g., MVC/MVVM) for clear separation of concerns.

## Future Enhancements (Possible Phase 2 & Beyond)

- **Commenting and Discussion**: Allow users to comment on concerns.
- **Multimedia Support**: Enable attaching images or videos to concerns.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Provide insights on trends across different geographical segments.
- **Push Notifications**: Notify users of updates on their posted concerns and leaderboard changes.
- **Integration with Social Media**: Allow sharing concerns on social media platforms for broader reach.

## Conclusion

This document outlines the specifications for an iOS app tailored for the Indian audience to share concerns, interact through votes, and view dynamic leaderboards across multiple geographic segments. The focus on intuitive design, secure authentication, and scalable architecture will ensure a robust platform for civic engagement. 

Please review and provide any feedback or further requirements for refinement.
